# Single Line Slack Notification - GitHub Action

This is a fork of [rtCamp/action-slack-notify](rtCamp/action/slack-notify) with the following changes:
* Changes the message to a single line with only core details
* Removes most configuration options to keep it simple
* Removes support for Vault 
* Updates Go dependencies

## Usage

You can use this action after any other action. Here is an example setup of this action:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/slack-notify.yml` file in your GitHub repo.
2. Add the following code to the `slack-notify.yml` file.
3. Only SLACK_WEBHOOK is required, the only available customization options are below. SLACK_ICON defaults to :x: so you probably want to set that to something else based on whether the run is successful or not.

```yml
on: push
name: Slack Notification Demo
jobs:
  slackNotification:
    name: Slack Notification
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Slack Notification
      uses: speechanddebate/action-slack-notify@master
      env:
        SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
        SLACK_CHANNEL: "#tech-updates"
        SLACK_USERNAME: "Github Actions"
        SLACK_ICON: ":white_check_mark:"
```

4. Create `SLACK_WEBHOOK` secret using [GitHub Action's Secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You can [generate a Slack incoming webhook token from here](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks).
